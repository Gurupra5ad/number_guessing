30 DAY Challenge - DAY 3

As a part of day 3 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I am coding a command line number guessing game where when the user starts the game, the computer will generate a random number and start giving clues for it. Maximum number of clues will be three and user has to find the number within the stipulated number of clues. If user successfully find the number they will be announced as winner or else they will announced as loser.

Later maybe this will be developed with a graphical user interface.
